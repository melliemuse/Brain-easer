A worry stone is a good to keep on hand so you have something to help ground yourself with when you are out and about. \n Sight: Count the number of red items in the room (or whatever color or class you like) again, this will help bring you into the present \n Taste: Use a cranberry or raisin- focus in on feeling the texture for a few minutes before biting into it, and spend some time with each bite. \n Hearing: Close your eyes and tune into all the sounds you hear. Stick with this for a few minutes, trying to identify at least 3 different noises. \n Smell: Find a fragrance you find pleasing and smell it when you are feeling anxious - carrying essential oils with you for this purpose can be handy when you need to ground yourself on the go"

If your parents, like, most people, did not possess this skill, then you do not either. That is why it is necessary for many people to go through the process of consciously developing the ability to self-soothe later in life. The idea behind inner child work is to provide nurturing to the emotional part of yourself that is psychologically young and vulnerable. Seeing yourself in this way helps you develop empathy for yourself in a way which might otherwise be difficult. Many times, emotional upset is tied to self-judgement, and often this has its roots in childhood. When we experience adverse experiences as children, we lack the cognitive skills to realize that what happened to us was not our fault, and we carry shame throughout our lives that can easily be triggered by everyday situations.",
