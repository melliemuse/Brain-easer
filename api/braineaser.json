It means that while you are in a certain frame of mind, it takes more effort to retrieve memories that were formed in another frame of mind, meaning, when you are anxious or depressed, your brain makes it hard to remember a time when you weren't feeling that way, and you have a harder time accessing the happy thoughts that could help pull you out.

Try to stick with this while you take some deep breaths • Find items with textures you find soothing like a fuzzy blanket or a silky pillow. Really tune into the sensation of feeling those textures and continue until you find some relief. A worry stone is a good to keep on hand so you have something to help ground yourself with when you are out and about. • Sight: Count the number of red items in the room (or whatever color or class you like) again, this will help bring you into the present • Taste: Use a cranberry or raisin- focus in on feeling the texture for a few minutes before biting into it, and spend some time with each bite. • • Hearing: Close your eyes and tune into all the sounds you hear. Stick with this for a few minutes, trying to identify at least 3 different noises. • Smell: Find a fragrance you find pleasing and smell it when you are feeling anxious - carrying essential oils with you for this purpose can be handy when you need to ground yourself on the go"

Unfortunately, most people do not have this skill, and if your parents, like, most people, did not posses this skill, you do not either. That is why it is neccessary for many people to go through this process to consciously to develop this skill later in life. The idea behind inner child work is to provide nurturing to the emotional part of yourself that is psychologically young and vulnerable. Seeing yourself in this way helps you develop empathy for yourself in a way that might otherwise be difficult. Many times, emotional upset is tied to self-judgement, whether or not that is immediatly apparent. When we experience any sort of adverse experience as a child, we lack the cognitive skills to realize that what happened to us was not our fault, and we carry shame throughout our lives that can easily be triggered by everyday situations.",

See how sweet and innocent you were. That is you. Do the thoughts and beliefs you are having match up with what you see when you look at that picture?

Forming a plan for how you will accomplish those tasks turns off that alarm because your brain is then satisfied that it's done its job in making sure you accomplish those tasks it deems important for your survival.
